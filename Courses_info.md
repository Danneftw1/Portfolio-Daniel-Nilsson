# Python Programming
This course we learned the fundamentals about programming using Python, since it's a very important part within machine learning to be able to progam. The course consisted of: 

* Input & Output
* If-statements
* While-statements
* For-statements
* Lists
* Strings
* Functions
* Error handling
* File handling
* Dictionaries
* Numpy
* Object oriented programming, abstract classes, dataclasses & theory
* Polymorphism
* Matplot
* Modules
* Simple machine learning algorithms

# Data Processing
This course we focused on learning concepts in data analysis. Typical techniques used for data exploration which is needed for machine learning. It consisted of: 

* Pandas basics
* Missing aggregation
* Plotly express
* Gapminder
* Merges
* Date & time
* API
* Anonymisation
* Code performance
* Data gathering

# Linear Algebra
In this course we learned the basics of linear algebra in order to understand the math behind many machine learning algorithms, and it consisted of: 

* Systems of linear equations
* Linear combinations
* Geometric vectors
* Lines & planes
* Scalar product
* Bases & linear independence
* Orthogonal basis & orthogonal projection
* Matrices
* Inverse of matrices
* Least squares method
* Linear mappings
* Eigenvalues

# Statistical Methods
This course was about probability theory and statistical basics needed for machine learning. It consisted of: 

* Descriptive statistics
* Probability theory
* Discrete distributions
* Continous distributions
* Sample distributions
* Confidence intervals
* Hypothesis tests
* Comparing two populations
* Bayseian inference
* Regression & Correlation

# Machine learning
This is one of the main courses for this program, and all of the courses above were a prerequisite for us to be able to finally start machine learning:

* More pandas
* Linear regression
* Gradient descent
* Sci-kit learn (sklearn)
* Polynomial regression
* Overfitting & underfitting
* Regularization
* Cross-validation
* Logistic regression
* K-nearest neighbors algorithm
* Support vector machine
* Decision trees
* Random forest
* Natural language processing (NLP)
* Naive bayes
* K-means 
* Principal component analysis (PCA)
* Artificial neural network (ANN)
