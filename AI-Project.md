When it comes to finding data specifically for the task of house pricing projections, we can go a few ways. First, I'd check if there was any open source data sets available for the task. This way we can possibly get a massive amount of data, however, we'll most likely have to clean it up and adapt it for our goal. If we can't find a reliable open source database, then we can use a web-scraping tool to help us collect data from websites. We could also use synthetic databases and manual data generation if we absolutely had to.
